The site-specific installation, made of decommissioned jute sacks, strip-woven and handmade fabric from the northern regions of Ghana as well as traditional garments known as “Fugu” or “Batakari”, is part of the exhibition and research project “TRANSFER(S)” and takes place within the framework of 375 years of the Peace of Westphalia. The installation is on view until October 1st, 2023.
              </p>
              <p>The second component of TRANSFER(S) takes place in Tamale (Ghana) and complements Mahama’s spatial intervention in Osnabrück with a discursive programme at @sccatamale in Ghana. During the period from November 28-2nd December, 2023 there will be panel discussions, seminars and performances produced in collaboration with academics, curators, historians and artists who will further unravel the historical-political strands that condition “TRANSFER(S)”.</p>

            Ibrahim Mahama was speaking about the development of the Savannah
            Center for Contemporary Art (SCCA) in Tamale, Ghana, on 1st of June
            2023. The artist-run center is a contribution to the development and
            expansion of the contemporary art scene in Ghana and is dedicated to
            art and cultural practices that emerged in the 20th century. The
            event is part of this year’s MARKK in Motion annual theme, „Giving
            Space – Taking Space.“ Ibrahim Mahama explores themes of migration,
            globalization, trade and production conditions in monumental
            installations. The artist’s works draw on materials from urban
            environments, such as wood scraps or used jute sacks, which are
            acquired in exchange and draped over architectural structures in
            collaboration with numerous people. Well-known works such as his
            contribution to documenta 14 and the Venice Biennale, which are
            commenting on colonial history and collaborative new production.

            This conversation brings together collaborators of the ambitious
            Institute for the Humanities-led project, In-Between the World and
            Dreams: Amanda Krugliak, Arts Curator UM Institute for the
            Humanities and Lead Curator; Ozi Uduma, Assistant Curator for Global
            Contemporary Art at UMMA; Laura De Becker, Curator of African Art
            and Interim Chief Curator at UMMA; Neil Alan Barclay, President and
            Chief Executive Officer of the Charles H. Wright Museum of African
            American History; and Ibrahim Mahama, internationally known Ghanaian
            artist and Director of the Savannah Center for the Arts in Tamale,
            Ghana. The project presents public facing installations at a time
            when our indoor spaces and opportunity for engagement with the arts
            are limited. Mahama's work acknowledges the troubling histories of
            colonialism and slavery in the Western world, and the labor of Black
            and brown people behind global exchange. At the same time, the work
            and overall project speaks to building new worlds out of failed
            systems, futures out of disappointments, asking the question, What
            can we do? Mahama addresses this prompt in a statement for the
            project: “promises of the present can start with ghosts from both
            the future and past. Ghosts are an embodiment of failed revolutions
            and unrealized futures, which need to be used as a starting point
            for new conversations within this century and beyond. Every life
            form is a gift.”

            Ibrahim Mahama is a visual artist who is actively involved in
            improving social conditions. His powerful artworks use provocative
            materials and sites to examine and expose histories, uphold the role
            of labour, challenge authorities and criticise mismanagement of
            resources. Directly addressing lack of opportunities and facilities
            in his home region, he has set up an open access cultural centre and
            other social projects providing employment, education, studio space
            and creative activities. Prince Claus Awards honour individuals and
            organisations for their excellent, ground- breaking work in culture
            and development. The seven 2020 Prince Claus Laureates were
            announced on 2 December in an online ceremony. Viewers watching from
            around the world were invited into the Royal Palace Amsterdam.
            During the programme, His Royal Highness Prince Constantijn of the
            Netherlands, Honorary Chair of the Prince Claus Fund, and the Dutch
            Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaag
            spoke about the power of culture.

            Living and working in Accra, Kumasi and Tamale, Ghanaian artist
            Ibrahim Mahama engages in the formation of architectural spaces
            inspired by the promise and failure of modernity. His installations
            often use material cues such as worn jute sacks to draw narratives
            of labour and movement of goods. His work has been shown at 56, 57
            and 58 Venice Biennale and documentary.

            <p>Video capturing Ibrahim Mahama’s sublime draping of the former Galeria Kaufhof building in Osnabrück’s
              city centre. The site-specific installation, made of decommissioned jute sacks, strip-woven and handmade
              fabric from the northern regions of Ghana as well as traditional garments known as “Fugu” or “Batakari”,
              is part of the exhibition and research project “TRANSFER(S)” and takes place within the framework of 375
              years of the Peace of Westphalia. The installation is on view until October 1st, 2023.
            </p>
            <p>The second component of TRANSFER(S) takes place in Tamale (Ghana) and complements Mahama’s spatial
              intervention in Osnabrück with a discursive programme at @sccatamale in Ghana. During the period from
              November 28-2nd December, 2023 there will be panel discussions, seminars and performances produced in
              collaboration with academics, curators, historians and artists who will further unravel the

            <p>Isaac Gyasi's participatory weaving project and durational exhibition.
            </p>
            <p>Isaac Gyasi is a weaving artist who has over 20 years of professional experience in textile design and
              practice, imparting knowledge of traditional Ghanaian weaving (Kente, Kete, Fugu), tapestry weaving, and
              broadloom weaving to students from KNUST and elsewhere. His outstanding contributions to design education
              and promotion, inventions and enhanced functionalities in weaving and fabric colouration are well
              recognised among many students. He has been weaving with straw, palm fronds, bamboo, and plantain fibres
              as well as dye colouration. His weaving practice aims at tracing and innovative synergizing the local
              technologies in the historical antecedents of traditional weaving and the contemporary weaving
              technologies. He does this by weaving and creating traditional designs that reconnect with the lost and
              unidentified Ghanaian cultural heritage as well as the unique hallmarks of ‘authentic' design
              complexities, patience, and resilience.</p>

            <p>Panelists: Ibrahim Mahama, Anna Jehle + Juliane Schickedanz Moderator: Bettina Klein & Kwasi Ohene-Ayeh.
            </p>
            <p>Anna Jehle + Juliane Schickedanz Since 2020, Anna Jehle and Juliane Schickedanz are co-directing
              Kunsthalle Osnabrück, one of the most important platforms for contemporary art in northern Germany,
              located in a former monastery and adjunct church. Curatorially, they work with annual themes such as
              “Disappointment” (2020), “Accessibility” (2021) or “Romanticism” (2022). Based on a structural interest
              and in the sense of a learning institution, the annual themes aim to tackle thematic complexes in a
              sustainable and more comprehensive approach through new artistic productions by internationally renowned
              artists. The Kunsthalle Osnabrück's programmes, which are conceptualised as processual and
              interdisciplinary, address socio-politically relevant issues and place an explicit focus on the inclusion
              of social processes that understand these issues as an integral part of cultural production. With its
              experimental and sensually tangible exhibitions and art mediation projects, the Kunsthalle has become a
              place for discourse and of conviviality that aims to transcend social boundaries.</p>

            <p>Performance by Bernard Akoi-Jackson.
            </p>
            <p>Bernard Akoi-Jackson (PhD) is a contemporary Ghanaian artist writer, curator and educator who lives and
              works from Tema/Accra/Kumasi or any site that loosely falls within his post-studio praxis. His general
              artistic practice and research trajectory revolve around his notion of ‘disturbed methodologies’,
              comprising a critique of post- and de-coloniality; an investigation of quotidian interactions and gestures
              through movement and object-oriented situations; and an engagement of linguistic quirks via textual
              inventions, revisions and wit. Akoi-Jackson is drawn to the politics of such vestiges of colonialist
              encounter as overtly bureaucratic rituals that lead to procedural stalemate in society. His
              multi-disciplinary, audience-implicating installations and performative pseudo-rituals, have featured in
              exhibitions across the world. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Koliko (collective) constitutes a loose collective of practitioners who share an interest in music and
              are based in Kumasi, Ghana. For the group music is a tool for entertainment and for the soul which ought
              to be available to everybody, irrespective of age, class, gender or racial background. Koliko’s music
              functions as a medium through which to express these egalitarian ideals. Inspired by the legendary Dr.
              Daniel Amponsah populary known as AGYA KOO NIMO, Afrobeat band Osibisa, founded in the late 1960s, and
              Kwame Yeboah’s “Ohia Bɛ Yɛ Ya” band, the group’s cosmopolitan sound appropriates from local highlife music
              (Adadamu, Burger highlife, etc), Jazz, Soul, Calypso, et al. </p>

            <p> Prof. Klaus Weber is a historian and Professor of European and Social History at the Europa Universität
              Viadrina (Frankfurt on the River Oder). In 2001 he submitted a Ph.D thesis at Universität Hamburg on
              German merchants in the 18th century Atlantic trade. Weber’s research interests also explore labour and
              welfare regimes in modern Europe and the Atlantic world and the global connections of central Europe’s
              early modern proto-industries. His text Linen, Silver, Slaves, and Coffee: A Spatial Approach to Central

              L'atelier Art competition in South Africa and was honoured as the recipient of the 2022 Yaa Asantewaa Art
              Prize. With a multidisciplinary approach, Priscilla Kennedy intricately weaves connections between body,
              race, sexuality, and fictional histories of objects with hybrid life forms. Her artistic practice
              encompasses diverse media, such as painting, tapestry, and light. These result in a tentacular
              deconstruction of the female body, including her own, as a multi-site for engaging conversation. </p>
