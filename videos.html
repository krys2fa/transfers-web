              From textiles and domestic objects to aircraft and a living museum
              installation, internationally acclaimed artist Ibrahim Mahama is
              known for his monumental installations in Ghana and beyond. His
              collections explore the significance of historical memory through
              everyday objects and his Red Clay Studio is a treasure trove of
              relics and artefacts. It’s a place where visitors explore their
              history, start new conversations about the past and imagine their
              futures – a studio of archives.

              Ibrahim Mahama was speaking about the development of the Savannah
              Center for Contemporary Art (SCCA) in Tamale, Ghana, on 1st of
              June 2023. The artist-run center is a contribution to the
              development and expansion of the contemporary art scene in Ghana
              and is dedicated to art and cultural practices that emerged in the
              20th century. The event is part of this year’s MARKK in Motion
              annual theme, „Giving Space – Taking Space.“ Ibrahim Mahama
              explores themes of migration, globalization, trade and production
              conditions in monumental installations. The artist’s works draw on
              materials from urban environments, such as wood scraps or used
              jute sacks, which are acquired in exchange and draped over
              architectural structures in collaboration with numerous people.
              Well-known works such as his contribution to documenta 14 and the
              Venice Biennale, which are commenting on colonial history and
              collaborative new production. Video Credits: Amin Motallebzadeh

              This conversation brings together collaborators of the ambitious
              Institute for the Humanities-led project, In-Between the World and
              Dreams: Amanda Krugliak, Arts Curator UM Institute for the
              Humanities and Lead Curator; Ozi Uduma, Assistant Curator for
              Global Contemporary Art at UMMA; Laura De Becker, Curator of
              African Art and Interim Chief Curator at UMMA; Neil Alan Barclay,
              President and Chief Executive Officer of the Charles H. Wright
              Museum of African American History; and Ibrahim Mahama,
              internationally known Ghanaian artist and Director of the Savannah
              Center for the Arts in Tamale, Ghana. The project presents public
              facing installations at a time when our indoor spaces and
              opportunity for engagement with the arts are limited. Mahama's
              work acknowledges the troubling histories of colonialism and
              slavery in the Western world, and the labor of Black and brown
              people behind global exchange. At the same time, the work and
              overall project speaks to building new worlds out of failed
              systems, futures out of disappointments, asking the question, What
              can we do? Mahama addresses this prompt in a statement for the
              project: “promises of the present can start with ghosts from both
              the future and past. Ghosts are an embodiment of failed
              revolutions and unrealized futures, which need to be used as a
              starting point for new conversations within this century and
              beyond. Every life form is a gift.”

              Ibrahim Mahama is a visual artist who is actively involved in
              improving social conditions. His powerful artworks use provocative
              materials and sites to examine and expose histories, uphold the
              role of labour, challenge authorities and criticise mismanagement
              of resources. Directly addressing lack of opportunities and
              facilities in his home region, he has set up an open access
              cultural centre and other social projects providing employment,
              education, studio space and creative activities. Prince Claus
              Awards honour individuals and organisations for their excellent,
              ground- breaking work in culture and development. The seven 2020
              Prince Claus Laureates were announced on 2 December in an online
              ceremony. Viewers watching from around the world were invited into
              the Royal Palace Amsterdam. During the programme, His Royal
              Highness Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands, Honorary Chair of
              the Prince Claus Fund, and the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade
              and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaag spoke about the power of

              Living and working in Accra, Kumasi and Tamale, Ghanaian artist
              Ibrahim Mahama engages in the formation of architectural spaces
              inspired by the promise and failure of modernity. His
              installations often use material cues such as worn jute sacks to
              draw narratives of labour and movement of goods. His work has been
              shown at 56, 57 and 58 Venice Biennale and documentary.
