          TRANSFER(S) is a site-oriented research and exhibition project sited
          between Osnabrück (Germany) and Tamale (Ghana) which draws on a
          plurality of historical and contemporary flows, knots, and contentions
          between Central Europe and West Africa with Ibrahim Mahama’s art
          practice as its muse. The project is commissioned by the Kunsthalle
          Osnabrück on the occasion of its 30th anniversary to doubly respond to
          the legacy of the Westphalia Peace Treaty—signed in Osnabrück and
          Münster 375 years ago—and the history of textile production in
          Osnabrück. TRANSFER(S) taps into the complexities of these two
          beginning points and engages them as ciphers of encoded economic,
          aesthetic, and socio-political relations transcending oceans and
          borders on a planetary scale. In this scope, the project aims to come
          to terms with the centrist-hierarchical power dynamics latent in these
          relationships which have engendered domination and exploitation since
          feudalist and mercantile capitalist regimes into our present day,
          while also generating alternative, disjunctive, and emancipatory
          trajectories through Mahama’s artistic vision and other discursive
          positions in an extended programme in Ghana with collaborators
          including historians, academics, DJs, and performers.

        <p class="text-justify">
          Mahama’s ecology of artistic forms instantiates the jute sack
          wrappings as a single strand, albeit the most popular, in his oeuvre.
          The artist’s expanded social practice has over the years mobilised a
          collectivist critique of capitalist modernity and its implications on
          everyday life through traces of its labour relations, commercial, and
          distribution networks. His collaborative, participatory, and social
          engineering strategies act as artistic decoys out of which materialist
          critiques of late capitalism are realised (whether by insisting on the
          visibility of the labour forces implicated in his works, or
          negotiating to acquire land as a means of reverse gentrification,
          among others). Mahama’s vintage use of threadbare burlap sacks
          (conventionally made from jute, flax, or hemp) as allegories of global
          agro-commodity trade speaks to such committed and politically-engaged
          practice. The artist’s recent foray into institution-building
          concretises his affirmative politics where he creates inclusive spaces
          and places in an attempt to subvert the extractive and exploitative
          logic of “accumulation by dispossession” endemic to the
          commodification of art and daily life—in a word, restitute art into
          the cultural commons in his hometown, Tamale, however contradictory
          this might prove as he deftly navigates the art market system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Osnabrück’s position in this project is relevant for two main reasons.
          In the first place, the city was, like Warendorf and Bielefeld, one of
          Westphalia’s major indigenous textile-producing cities with a
          cottage-industrial production of linen flourishing since the late
          medieval period. This high-quality linen, domestically produced in
          mills from the fibrous stalks of the home-grown flax plant, was
          Germany’s most important export commodity to the rest of Europe during
          the early modern maritime trade, in addition to the trade of metal
          ware and glassware. Eventually, influential local merchant families
          from Osnabrück begun to mass distribute the linen fabric (famously
          known as true born Osnabrughs) to other major European trading venues
          such as Càdiz, Nantes, and London via North German and Dutch port
          cities to the Hispano-American and Atlantic markets. According to
          German historian Klaus Weber, linen probably made up to 90% of the
          German-English trade by the end of the 17th century. The production of
          linen in Osnabrück had thus become entangled with the slave trade and
          plantation economy by means of powerful global flows of goods and
          capital making use of port cities in Bremen, Bordeaux, London, and
          Hamburg to reach the African markets. Invariably, linen had become a
          crucial commodity to the economy of the transatlantic slave trade both
          as a barter commodity for captives from Africa’s coastal regions and
          in making garments for the forced labourers (including the European
          “indentured servants” or “engagés”) working on plantations in the West
          Indies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Secondly, TRANSFER(S) coincides with the jubilee year for Osnabrück as
          2023 marks 375 years since the Peace of Westphalia was achieved in
          Europe. The Peace of Westphalia generally describes the entirety of
          peace treaties concluded between the Holy Roman Empire, Austria,
          Brandenburg, the Dutch Republic, France, the Papacy, Spain, and Sweden
          on German soil, in the town halls of Münster and Osnabrück in 1648.
          The Westphalian system effectively ended the era of sectarian warfare
          during the Thirty Years War (1618 to 1648) fought between feuding
          Catholic and Protestant estates within the Holy Roman Empire which
          developed to involve most of Europe. The standard Western discourse on
          the Peace Treaty is that the Westphalian system inaugurated the
          principle of religious freedom and tolerance in Europe after more than
          100 years of conflict. The Treaty also governed the structure of
          power, establishing the sovereignty of its member states as it
          balanced power between the Holy Roman Emperor and the princes.
          Thirdly, it inaugurated international diplomacy as a means of conflict
          resolution rather than resorting to military force in the struggles
          for hegemony by European empires to achieve religious, political, and
          economic domination. In this regard, the Westphalian sovereign states
          system is relevant to this day in political science as a successful
          model in achieving political and economic stability in Europe while
          serving as a watershed moment in history by establishing the earliest
          foundations for a European community of states, hence legitimizing the
          formation of post-war supranational communities such as the United
          Nations and the European Union. However, the Dutch historian Prof. Dr.
          Beatrice de Graaf gives us a counter-position to this standard
          narrative when she intimates that: "While the successful negotiations
          of Osnabrück and Münster brought the long-awaited peace to the people
          of Europe, the now pacified states turned their gaze outward, [as
          they] expanded and founded colonies. […] Thus, it was not until the
          Peace of Westphalia in the 17th century that economic empires could
          emerge whose financial resources and technologies made possible the
          great expansionist moves of the Netherlands in the 17th century,
          England in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the German Empire in the
          late 19th century” (Deutscher Historikertag, 2018). This critical
          perspective opens up a gaping paradox in the consensus on the Peace
          Treaty and complicates the picture by surfacing the unbridled violence
          and traumatic realities visited upon non-Europeans as a consequence of
          the Westphalian system.

        <p class="text-justify">
          There are two broad components to this research and exhibition
          project. For the first part Mahama merges the forlorn sacks with
          strip-woven textiles specifically made by local artisans in the
          northern region of Ghana, as well as locally collected garments/smocks
          (also made in Ghana from strip-cloths, popularly referred to as ‘fugu’
          or ‘batakari’), to create a monumental site-oriented installation
          which drapes the south-west, south-east, and north-east façades of the
          former Galeria Kaufhof in Osnabrück. The tilted mid-rise architecture
          of the Kaufhof was built in 1955 as Merkur department store on the
          site of Hotel Germania (known from E. M. Remarque's novel The Black
          Obelisk) which was destroyed during the Second World War. Tessellated
          with iconic “Horten tiles”, designed by the German modernist architect
          Helmut Hentrich, the former department store or “temple of
          consumption” (as described in a local newspaper) now stands as a
          shadow of what it used to signify. The derelict building currently
          stands in the city centre awaiting a new future as it will be
          converted by the Hamburg-based project developer Imvest
          Projektentwicklung GmbH and, as of 2025, will house a multifunctional
          complex for shops, offices, gastronomy, co-working spaces as well as
          the departments of Art/Art Education and Textile Design of the
          University of Osnabrück.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          The second component of the project augments Mahama’s spatial
          intervention in Osnabrück with discursive, relational, and gestural
          forms programmed at the Savanna Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)
          Tamale in Ghana. SCCA Tamale is one of three institutions founded by
          Mahama in his hometown, with the other two being Red Clay and Nkrumah
          Voli-Ni. On the one hand, SCCA Tamale and its sister-institutions
          constitute a fragment of Mahama’s interventionist and
          counter-gentrification strategies launched as a response to the lack
          of hard or physical infrastructure needed to sustain art practice in
          Ghana. On the other hand, they also function as a complex hub of
          artist-run cultural spaces with facilities ranging from gallery,
          natural history museum, greenhouse, library, cinema, studios, and
          more. The institution is dedicated to hosting local and international
          events. At a later point in the year SCCA Tamale will serve as the
          discursive hub where the historical-political strands of the research
          premises are deciphered in a series of roundtables, seminars,
          exhibitions, performances, and presentations programmed to generate
          more perspectives with academics, curators, performers, historians,
          musicians, and artists.
