          “TRANSFER(S)” is a trans-regional research and generative exhibition
          project conceived by Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama, and co-curators
          Kwasi Ohene-Ayeh and Bettina Klein, which examines and excavates a
          plurality of historical and contemporary transfer circuits connecting
          central Europe to West Africa. The project takes place between
          Osnabrück (Germany) and Tamale (Ghana).

            This is an installation by Ibrahim Mahama that is displayed on the
            façade of an architectural object in the city center of Osnabrück.
            The installation is made up of threadbare burlap sacks that are
            merged with strip-woven textiles produced by local artisans in the
            northern region of Ghana.

            This is a series of discursive, relational, and gestural forms that
            are programmed at the Savanna Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)
            Tamale in Ghana. The SCCA Tamale is one of three institutions
            founded by Ibrahim Mahama in his hometown of Tamale. The other two
            institutions are Red Clay and Nkrumah Voli-Ni.
