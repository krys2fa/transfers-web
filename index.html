              merged with strip-woven textiles produced by local artisans in the

        <p>
          On the occasion of Osnabrück&#39;s anniversary celebration of 375 years since the
Peace of Westphalia, the internationally renowned artist Ibrahim Mahama is
dedicating himself to investigating the city’s history of linen trade in his new
research and exhibition project dubbed TRANSFER(S), initiated in cooperation
with the Kunsthalle Osnabrück. From 9 July to 1 October 2023, the Ghanaian artist
will wrap the former Galeria Kaufhof building in Osnabrück&#39;s city centre with a
monumental tapestry of strip-woven textiles, locally collected smocks from Ghana,
and his signature repurposed jute sacks.</p>



<p>The former Galeria Kaufhof building with its equally diverse history and future
realignment is ideal for these debates in addition to serving as the primary site of
Mahama’s artistic intervention in Osnabrück. As early as 1955, the Merkur

department store had opened there on the site of the Hotel Germania (known from
E. M. Remarque&#39;s novel &quot;The Black Obelisk&quot;), which had been destroyed during
the Second World War. Local city history, war, and post-war experiences are thus
placed in the context of global trade and power relations through Mahama&#39;s
intervention. The building is currently being converted by the Hamburg-based
project developer Home United and, as of 2024, will house not only the cross-
community space &quot;Osnabrücker Ding&quot; but also, among others, the departments of
&quot;Art/Art Education&quot; and &quot;Textile Design&quot; of the University of Osnabrück.</p>

<p>In addition to Mahama&#39;s installation in Osnabrück, &quot;TRANSFER(S)&quot; also includes
an accompanying discursive programme at the Savannah Centre for
Contemporary Art (SCCA Tamale) in Ghana. SCCA Tamale is one of three
institutions Mahama has established in his hometown. This autumn, the
establishment will serve as a discursive hub where the historical-political strands
of the research premises will be unravelled in a series of talks, seminars,
exhibitions, performances and presentations. The events are designed to create
further perspectives in exchange with academics, curators, historians, musicians
and artists.</p>

          <p>TRANSFER(S) explores a variety of historical and contemporary transfer circuits
            between Central Europe and West Africa. Thematically, it ties in with Osnabrück&#39;s
            historical importance as one of the most important textile production regions in
            Westphalia, among others, for linen fabric, which became known as &quot;true born
            Osnabrughs&quot; and dates back to the fourteenth century. This linen was also used
            as a means of exchange for captives from the coastal regions of Africa and to
            make clothing for the forced labourers working on the plantations of the West
            Indies.</p>
