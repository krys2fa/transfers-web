        TRANSFER(S): From Osnabrück to Tamale
      </h1>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
        Discursive programme at Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)
        Tamale, Ghana <br> November 28 - December 1, 2023
        </centre>
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify"> The solo exhibition and research project by Ibrahim Mahama dubbed TRANSFER(S) morphed
        into discursive and relational forms in its second phase and shifted its locus from Osnabrück in Germany to
        Tamale in Ghana. From 28th November to 1st December, Red Clay and its sister institutions, Savannah Centre of
        Contemporary Art (SCCA) Tamale, and Nkrumah Voli-ni (institutions founded by Mahama), hosted a plurality of
        perspectives coming together to supplement the artist’s and curators’ positions. To this end, weavers,
        academics, technicians, historians, musicians, publishers, fellow artists, and curators are invited as
        co-workers and/or co-producers with whom to proliferate the aesthetic-historical-political strands of the
        project which was done through symposiums, community-based workshops, temporary exhibitions, durational
        performances, lectures, and live music.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">TRANSFER(S) was launched in Germany on July 8 en plein air with a monumental installation
        of Mahama’s montaged tapestry of strip-woven textiles, decommissioned jute sacks and batakaris (traditional
        garments cumulated from the northern region of Ghana) which draped the south-west, south-east, and north-east
        façades of the now-closed Galeria Kaufhof building in Osnabrück until October 1st, 2023. The exhibition engages
        a plurality of historical and contemporary flows, knots, and contentions between Central Europe and West Africa
        with Ibrahim Mahama’s art practice as its muse. The project is commissioned by the Kunsthalle Osnabrück on the
        occasion of its 30th anniversary to doubly respond to the legacy of the Westphalia Peace Treaty—signed in the
        neighboring towns of Osnabrück and Münster 375 years ago—and the history of textile production in Osnabrück.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">TRANSFER(S) engages textiles in seven registers: as signifier, image, means of production,
        cipher, material, technology, and form of sociality. The exhibition taps into the complexities of the thematic
        points and engages them as integers of encoded economic, aesthetic, and socio-political relations transcending
        oceans and borders on a planetary scale. In this scope, the project aims to come to terms with the
        centrist-hierarchical power dynamics latent in these relationships which have engendered domination and
        exploitation since feudalist and mercantile capitalist regimes into our present day, while also generating
        alternative, disjunctive, and emancipatory trajectories through Mahama’s artistic vision and other discursive
        positions in an extended programme in Ghana.

            lives and works from Tema/Accra/Kumasi or any site that loosely falls within his post-studio praxis. His
            general artistic practice and research trajectory revolve around his notion of ‘disturbed methodologies’,
            comprising a critique of post- and de-coloniality; an investigation of quotidian interactions and gestures
            through movement and object-oriented situations; and an engagement of linguistic quirks via textual
            inventions, revisions and wit. Akoi-Jackson is drawn to the politics of such vestiges of colonialist
            encounter as overtly bureaucratic rituals that lead to procedural stalemate in society. His
            multi-disciplinary, audience-implicating installations and performative pseudo-rituals, have featured in
            exhibitions across the world.

            <br><b>Zohra Opoku and The Revival:</b> A collaborative body of work by Ghana-based artists Zohra Opoku and
            The Revival (co-founded by Kwamena Boison & Yayra Agbofah) which is a community-led sustainable design
            non-profit entity educating and creating awareness with upcycled global textile waste. For Zohra Opoku, this
            collaboration will be a continuation/extension of her ‘WHO IS WEARING MY T-SHIRT' series, which was devoted
            to the work of unpacking interconnectedness, highlighted at the intersection of trade and textile. Zohra
            Opoku’s ongoing series explores the fraught relation between the second-hand Imports to Sub-Saharan Africa,
            the modern African textile industry and traditional African attire.
            <br><br>About the project:
            <br>An immersive installation unfolds, featuring patchwork-style vintage textiles from Kantamanto. In a
            traditional-inspired procession, Kayayei women gracefully transport the piece on wooden boards and aluminum
            bowls, resulting in a captivating final image—a suspended hut shape gracefully occupying the space.

            <br><b>Anna Jehle + Juliane Schickedanz</b> Since 2020, Anna Jehle and Juliane Schickedanz are co-directing
            Kunsthalle Osnabrück, one of the most important platforms for contemporary art in northern Germany, located
            in a former monastery and adjunct church. Curatorially, they work with annual themes such as
            “Disappointment” (2020), “Accessibility” (2021) or “Romanticism” (2022). Based on a structural interest and
            in the sense of a learning institution, the annual themes aim to tackle thematic complexes in a sustainable
            and more comprehensive approach through new artistic productions by internationally renowned artists. The
            Kunsthalle Osnabrück's programmes, which are conceptualised as processual and interdisciplinary, address
            socio-politically relevant issues and place an explicit focus on the inclusion of social processes that
            understand these issues as an integral part of cultural production. With its experimental and sensually
            tangible exhibitions and art mediation projects, the Kunsthalle has become a place for discourse and of
            conviviality that aims to transcend social boundaries.
