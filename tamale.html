          TRANSFER(S): From Osnabrück to Tamale
        </h1>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
          Discursive programme at Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)
          Tamale, Ghana <br> November 28 - December 1, 2023
        </centre></p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>TRANSFER(S)</b> opened on July 8th, 2023, with a monumental installation
          of Ibrahim Mahama’s montaged tapestry of strip-woven textiles,
          decommissioned jute sacks and batakaris (traditional garments
          cumulated from the northern region of Ghana) draping the south-west,
          south-east, and north-east façades of the now-closed Galeria Kaufhof
          building in Osnabrück’s Neumarkt district. Through Mahama’s work, the
          exhibition-slash-research project examines two immanent registers: 1)
          Osnabrück’s cottage-industrial production of textiles since the late
          medieval period—specifically linen with its trade and distribution to
          other parts of Central Europe—and its connection to the trans-Atlantic
          slave trade and plantation economy. And 2) the paradox of the “Peace
          of Westphalia”—the culmination of two peace treaties signed in the
          neighbouring cities of Osnabrück and Münster in 1648 which ended the
          devastating Thirty Years’ War in Europe. While the Westphalian system
          ended sectarian warfare and brought peace to Europe after a century of
          conflict—thereby inaugurating principles of religious tolerance, the
          sovereignty of member states, international diplomacy, among
          others—its conclusion 375 years ago also catalysed the consolidation
          of the European capitalist world economy and colonial expansionist
          project that transpired during the 17th century with consequences for
          our world today. Therefore, the complex leitmotifs of textile (as
          signifier, image, cipher, means of production, material, technology,
          and form of sociality) in the context of Mahama’s solo exhibition for
          <b>TRANSFER(S)</b> respond to these registers in various ways.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          <b><i>TRANSFER(S): From Osnabrück to Tamale</i></b>, being the second phase
          of the project, emphasizes its research dimension with thematic
          interests encompassing the mercantile flows of commodities in the form
          of human and non-human barter objects, Christian missionisation
          (Lutherism, Calvininism, Zwinglianism), and colonialism with its
          global consequences for education, religion, economics, culture, and
          geopolitics. The shift from Germany to Ghana also allows for a
          cross-Atlantic mobility of another kind; one that comes to terms with
          our shared histories and affirmative futures at one and the same time.
          Pivoting from Osnabrück’s public space (which displayed Mahama’s
          site-specific installation until 1st October, 2023), SCCA Tamale will
          function as the discursive hub where a plurality of perspectives come
          together to augment the artist’s and curators’ positions. In this
          respect, academics, dramatists, technicians, historians, musicians,
          publishers, fellow artists, and curators are invited as co-workers
          and/or co-producers with whom to proliferate the
          aesthetic-historical-political strands of <b>TRANSFER(S)</b> which will be
          disseminated through roundtable talks, community-based workshops,
          temporary exhibitions, performances, lectures and presentations
          between November 28 and December 1, 2023.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          <b>TRANSFER(S)</b> is co-curated by Kwasi Ohene-Ayeh and Bettina Klein and is
          under the auspices of Kunsthalle Osnabrück.

        <!-- <p class="text-white fs-3">Summary:</p> -->

        <!-- <p class="text-justify">
          This second component of the project emphasizes the research dimension
          in addition to Ibrahim Mahama’s site-specific installation which will
          be on view in Osnabrück until 1st October, 2023. SCCA Tamale will
          serve as the discursive hub where the historico-political strands of
          the research premises are deciphered in a series of roundtables,
          seminars, exhibitions, performances, and presentations programmed to
          generate more perspectives with academics, curators, dramatists,
          historians, musicians, and artists.
